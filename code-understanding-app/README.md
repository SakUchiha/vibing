## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- OpenAI API key (for AI Assistant functionality)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd code-understanding-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend/server.js
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Open the frontend**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser
   - Or navigate to `http://localhost:4000` (if serving from server)

### Quick Start (Windows)

1. Double-click `start-app.bat` to automatically install dependencies and start the server
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser

## OpenAI AI Assistant Setup

The AI Assistant requires an OpenAI API key to function. Follow these steps to set it up:

### 1. Get an OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key (it starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Configure the API Key

Add your OpenAI API key to the backend configuration:

1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend/server.js/` directory
2. Add the following lines:
   ```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=foll
   PORT=4000
   ```

### 3. Verify Configuration

The server will automatically load the API key from the `.env` file when it starts. Make sure the key is properly set before using the AI Assistant features.

### 4. Troubleshooting AI (OpenRouter)

**If AI Assistant shows "unavailable":**
- Verify your `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is correctly set in the `.env` file
- Ensure you have credits with your chosen provider via OpenRouter
- Ensure the backend server is running on port 4000 (or 4001 fallback)
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**Common AI Issues:**
- **"Invalid API key"**: Double-check `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your `.env`
- **"Insufficient credits"**: Add credits or choose a different model
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Wait a few minutes before trying again
- **Network errors**: Check your internet connection
