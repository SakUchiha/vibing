## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- OpenAI API key (for AI Assistant functionality)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd code-understanding-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend/server.js
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Open the frontend**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser
   - Or navigate to `http://localhost:4000` (if serving from server)

### Quick Start (Windows)

1. Double-click `start-app.bat` to automatically install dependencies and start the server
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser

## OpenAI AI Assistant Setup

The AI Assistant requires an OpenAI API key to function. Follow these steps to set it up:

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in to your OpenAI account (or create one)
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the API key (save it securely - you won't be able to see it again)

### 2. Configure the Backend

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/server.js/` directory:

```bash
cd backend/server.js
touch .env
```

Add your API key to the `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 3. Verify Configuration

Restart the server and check that the AI assistant works:

```bash
# Restart the server
node server.js

# Check AI status in the browser
# Navigate to AI Assistant page and check the status indicator
```

### 4. Troubleshooting OpenAI Setup

**If API key is not configured:**
- Make sure the `.env` file exists in `backend/server.js/`
- Verify the API key format starts with `sk-`
- Restart the server after adding the key

**If API calls fail:**
- Check your OpenAI account has credits
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check network connectivity
- Review OpenAI status page: https://status.openai.com

**If AI Assistant shows "unavailable":**
- Verify `.env` file exists with correct API key
- Restart the KidLearner backend server
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Ensure OpenAI API is accessible from your network

     "id": "unique-id",
     "title": "Lesson Title",
     "category": "HTML|CSS|JavaScript",
     "difficulty": "Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced",
     "duration": "X minutes",
     "summary": "Brief description",
     "description": "Detailed description",
     "slides": [...],
     "learningObjectives": [...],
     "exercise": {
       "description": "Exercise description",
       "starter": "Starting code",
       "hints": [...]
     }
   }
   ```

### Modifying Styles

- The design uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern layouts
- Color scheme can be modified by changing CSS custom properties

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Check if port 4000 is available
- Run `npm install` in the backend/server.js directory

### Frontend Not Loading
- Make sure the server is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Try opening the HTML files directly in your browser

### AI Assistant Not Working
- **First, ensure OpenAI API key is configured** (see OpenAI Setup section above)
- Check that the `.env` file exists in `backend/server.js/`
- Verify the API key format (should start with `sk-`)
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Make sure the backend server is running on port 4000
- Try restarting the KidLearner server

### Common OpenAI Issues
- **"API key not configured"**: Add OpenAI API key to `.env` file
- **"Invalid API key"**: Verify your API key from OpenAI platform
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Wait a few minutes before trying again
- **Network errors**: Check internet connection and OpenAI status
