## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Ollama (for AI Assistant functionality)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd code-understanding-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend/server.js
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Open the frontend**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser
   - Or navigate to `http://localhost:4000` (if serving from server)

### Quick Start (Windows)

1. Double-click `start-app.bat` to automatically install dependencies and start the server
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser

## Ollama AI Assistant Setup

The AI Assistant requires Ollama to be installed and running locally. Follow these steps to set it up:

### 1. Install Ollama

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ollama
```

**Windows:**
Download from https://ollama.ai/download and run the installer.

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Start Ollama Service

```bash
ollama serve
```

This starts Ollama on `http://localhost:11434`.

### 3. Download Required Models

Download the recommended models for best performance:

```bash
# Primary model (fast and good quality)
ollama pull gemma3:1b

# Alternative models (if you prefer different sizes/speeds)
ollama pull llama3.2:1b    # Fast, good quality
ollama pull llama3.2:3b    # Better quality, slower
ollama pull phi3:3.8b      # Good balance
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Check if Ollama is running and models are available:

```bash
# Check service status
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Test a simple chat
ollama run gemma3:1b "Hello, test message"
```

### 5. Troubleshooting Ollama

**If Ollama won't start:**
- Make sure port 11434 is not blocked by firewall
- Try `ollama serve` in a new terminal
- Check if another instance is already running

**If models won't download:**
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Try pulling smaller models first: `ollama pull llama3.2:1b`

**If AI Assistant shows "unavailable":**
- Verify Ollama is running: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
- Check that required models are pulled
- Restart the KidLearner backend server
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Model Recommendations

| Model | Size | Speed | Quality | Use Case |
|-------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| `gemma3:1b` | ~1.5GB | Fastest | Good | Default, best balance |
| `llama3.2:1b` | ~1.3GB | Fast | Good | Alternative default |
| `llama3.2:3b` | ~2GB | Medium | Better | More detailed responses |
| `phi3:3.8b` | ~2.3GB | Medium | Best | Most comprehensive |

   {
     "id": "unique-id",
     "title": "Lesson Title",
     "category": "HTML|CSS|JavaScript",
     "difficulty": "Beginner|Intermediate|Advanced",
     "duration": "X minutes",
     "summary": "Brief description",
     "description": "Detailed description",
     "slides": [...],
     "learningObjectives": [...],
     "exercise": {
       "description": "Exercise description",
       "starter": "Starting code",
       "hints": [...]
     }
   }
   ```

### Modifying Styles
- Edit `frontend/css/styles.css` to customize the appearance
- The design uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern layouts
- Color scheme can be modified by changing CSS custom properties

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Check if port 4000 is available
- Run `npm install` in the backend/server.js directory

### Frontend Not Loading
- Make sure the server is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Try opening the HTML files directly in your browser

### AI Assistant Not Working
- **First, ensure Ollama is installed and running** (see Ollama Setup section above)
- Check that required models are downloaded: `ollama list`
- Verify Ollama service: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Make sure the backend server is running on port 4000
- Try restarting both Ollama and the KidLearner server

### Common Ollama Issues
- **"Connection refused"**: Ollama service not running - run `ollama serve`
- **"Model not found"**: Download the model - `ollama pull gemma3:1b`
- **"Port 11434 blocked"**: Check firewall settings
- **Slow responses**: Try a smaller model like `llama3.2:1b`
